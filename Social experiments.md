### Abstract
Some interesting social experiments that show 'unexpected' human behavior 

### Explanation
###### Stanford prison experiment
[Stanford prison experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) was designed to examine the effects of situational variables on participants' reactions and behaviors in a two-week simulation of a prison environment. Stanford University psychology professor Philip Zimbardo led the research team who ran the study in the summer of 1971.

###### Robbers Cave experiment
The 1954 Robbers [Cave experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory#Robbers_Cave_study) (or Robbers Cave study) by Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif represents one of the most widely known demonstrations of RCT. The Sherifs' study was conducted over three weeks in a 200-acre summer camp in Robbers Cave State Park, Oklahoma, focusing on intergroup behavior. In this study, researchers posed as camp personnel, observing 22 eleven- and twelve-year-old boys who had never previously met and had comparable backgrounds (each subject was a white eleven to twelve-year-old boy of average to slightly above average intelligence from a Protestant, middle-class, two-parent home).

This experiment is support of [[Realistic conflict theory]]

Lutfy Diab repeated the experiment with 18 boys from Beirut. The 'Blue Ghost' and 'Red Genies' groups each contained 5 Christians and 4 Muslims. Fighting soon broke out, not Christian vs Muslim but Blue vs Red.
