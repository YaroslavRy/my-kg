**Absorption coeff ~ Wavelength**

It's explain for example, why red light come through your skin when you flashing your hand by red light.
Good window: far red - near infrared.

- Two-photon microscopy can achieve the same point spread function as confocal, _without_ pinhole.
- In two-photon excitation, the focal voulme is defined by a point of light itself.

We measure all emission that comes from focus (it not affected by near tissues, we know that all emission comes from single focus point)
