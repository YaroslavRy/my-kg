Benzodiazepines do not activate GABAa receptors on their own, but only potentiate GABA-evoked currents.

Benzodiazepines increase the affinity of GABA for binding to the GABAa receptor.

Not all GABAa - $\alpha$ subunits are sensitive to Benzodiazepines. 
They potentiate GABAa receptors containing the $\alpha 1$, $\alpha 2$, $\alpha 3$, $\alpha 5$ subunits, but it has no effect upon $\alpha 4$, $\alpha 6$.
Difference here is in histidine and arginine.
Histidine must be for affinity to benzodiazepines but not the arginine
