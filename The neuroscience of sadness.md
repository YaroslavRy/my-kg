### Abstract
*The neuroscience of sadness: A multidisciplinary synthesis and collaborative review.*
 
 **Highlights**
- Sadness involves reduction of cortical control over evolutionarily ancient brain systems.
- Basic emotion theorists have identified a SADNESS circuit, based on animal research.
- Psychological constructionists have identified patterns of activity that dependent on context.
- Competing models may relate to different levels on a phylogenetic hierarchy.
- Dedicated funding to facilitate collaborative and transdisciplinary opportunities is needed.

### Explanation
##### The heritability of sadness

##### Neuroimaging

Fig. 2. Neurocircuitry of basic emotions. (A) Lateral and medial views of the unique and prototypical representation of sadness in comparison to other basic emotions across multiple brain regions, including those associated to Salience (e.g., anterior cingulate and insula), Default Mode (e.g., medial prefrontal and hippocampus), Frontoparietal (e.g., lateral prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate), and Visceromotor (e.g., cerebellum/brainstem) systems. (B) Connectional profiles associated to each emotion category in anatomical space of the brain. The nodes (circles) are regions or networks, color-coded by anatomical system. The edges (lines) reflect co-activation between pairs of regions or networks. The size of each circle reflects its betweenness-centrality, a measure of how strongly it connects disparate networks. One location is depicted for each cortical network for visualization purposes, though the networks were distributed across regions (see A). Compared to other emotions, sadness involves largely isolated brain networks, with large-scale connectivity among major systems essentially lacking. Specifically, sadness includes dramatically reduced connectivity within the cortex, and between cortical and subcortical systems, while connectivity within cerebellar/brainstem systems seems rather exaggerated. These network functional patterns seemingly link sadness to a neurocognitive profile inclined/biased towards interoceptive and homeostatic information processing.
