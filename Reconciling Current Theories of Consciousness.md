Understanding the neural basis of [[Consciousness]] is one of the fundamental challenges in modern neuroscience. A number of sophisticated models and theories have attempted to formalize how the brain implements consciousness using insights from philosophy, psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. These include two major and perhaps competing theories, the [[integrated information theory]] (IIT) and the [[global neuronal workspace]] (GNW) theory, which differ mainly in their level of conceptual abstraction and anatomical specificity.
