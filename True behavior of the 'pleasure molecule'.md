#### Abstract
Dopamine in Nucleus accumbens core (NAc) does not track reward prediction error in negative reinforcement learning task.
Research shows that dopamine level increase in response to stressful stimuli, and not just to pleasurable ones, potentially rewriting facts about 'feel-good' hormone.

Figure 1. Dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core does not track reward prediction error in negative reinforcement tasks (A) Positive reinforcement task. (B) Dopamine was recorded via fiber photometry using dLight1.1. (C) Mice made more active than inactive responses during the post-training session (t6 = 3.18, p = 0.024; n = 6). (D and E) Heatmaps showing dopamine responses aligned around Sd,sucrose (left) and head entry (right) during (D) pre-training and (E) post-training. Each row represents a single Sd,sucrose presentation or head entry. (F and G) Averaged traces showing Sd,sucrose (F) and (G) head entry responses during pre- and post-training. (H) Dopamine increased to the Sd,sucrose (F1,153 = 10.79, p = 0.0013) and decreased to head entries over training (F1,75 = 11.17, p = 0.0013). (I) Negative reinforcement task. (J) Fiber photometry recording design. (K) Behavioral performance during negative reinforcement post-training session (t4 = 9.35, p < 0.001; n = 5). (L and M) Heatmaps of dopamine responses aligned around Sd,shock (left), footshock (center), and safety cue (right) during pre-training (L) and (M) post-training. (N–P) Dopamine traces to Sd,shock (N), (O) safety cue, and (P) footshock pre- and post-training. (Q) Dopamine response to Sd,shock (F1,96 = 1.52, p = 0.220), footshock (F1,127 = 4.00, p = 0.047), and safety cues (F1,95 = 15.46, p = 0.0002). Error bars represent ± S.E.M. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001. Credit: DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2021.08.052
