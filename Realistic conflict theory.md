### Abstract
Realistic conflict theory (initialized RCT), also known as realistic group conflict theory (initialized RGCT),[1][2] is a social psychological model of intergroup conflict.[3] The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of prejudice and discrimination toward the outgroup that accompany the intergroup hostility.[1][3][4] Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived scarcity of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status.

### Explanation
Feelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a zero-sums fate, in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the "winning" group achieving the limited resource first).[1][2] The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource.[1][3] According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if superordinate goals are in place.[1]
